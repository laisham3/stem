# File Input and Output in Python

### Overview
In this project you will be manipulating a list of the [~300,000 most commonly used words in the English language according to Google Ngrams](http://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1w.txt) (hosted by Peter Norvig). The file containing this data is called `common_words.txt` and is formatted in two tab-separated columns, with the word in the first column and its frequency in the second.

Ultimately our goal is to use the words in this file to generate easily memorable yet relatively cryptographically secure passphrases akin to those generated by [diceware](http://world.std.com/~Ereinhold/diceware.html). The following exercises will walk you through the steps necessary to format our file for this use.

### Instructions

1. If you haven't already, clone this repository to your working directory: `git clone https://github.com/denriconbhs/stem`
2. Navigate to the directory containing this repository and open the Python command line interpreter: `python`
3. Open and read out the contents of the file using either `.read()`, `.readlines()`, or by iterating over the file object using a `for` loop.
4. Find a way to open and print out only the first column of the file.
5. Write this new data to a file called `only_words.txt`
6. Open `only_words.txt` and print out the first 2,000 words with at least 4 letters
7. Write this new truncated list to a file called `select_words.txt`
