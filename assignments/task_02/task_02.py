# Write a function called total that takes a filename as its only argument and returns the sum of the numbers in that file. 
# You may assume that the file is formatted in such a way that each number is an integer and occupies its own line.
# You may not assume you know how many numbers are in the file.

# The file numbers.txt in this directory follows these guidelines.
