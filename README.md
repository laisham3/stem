# Introduction to Engineering

### Overview
This repository hosts materials for Mr. Enrico's _Intro to Engineering_ class at North Bergen High School. Like the course itself,
this repo is a work in progress and subject to frequent change. Generally speaking, the `/notes` folder contains class notes, the `/examples` folder contains short sample exercises that support lessons in the `/notes` folder, and the `/assignments` folder includes unsolved problems with doctests for self-checking. 

__Why are the example solutions encrypted?__
_Some students find having the solutions readily at hand a bit too tempting. Having to decrypt the answers may give these students extra time to consider redoubling their efforts before peeking, and adds a kind of failsafe against moments of weakness. I feel that so much of engineering in general and programming in particular is learning to push through difficulties!_

_Additionally, it gives students an opportunity to learn a bit about asymmetric-key cryptography and use it in the wild. My public key is in `pubkey.txt`, found in the root directory._
